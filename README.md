# 🔐 OctaCrypt

**OctaCrypt** is an open-source cryptographic toolkit developed by **Octagram**, focused on secure communication, strong encryption, privacy, and responsible key management.

OctaCrypt is designed with a clear philosophy: **security through transparency**. All cryptographic primitives used are well-known, audited, and widely trusted. We do not invent new cryptography — we implement it correctly.

## 🧭 Project Philosophy

> "True security is not achieved by hiding systems, but by allowing them to be examined — and still remain strong."

OctaCrypt follows these core principles:

* 🔍 **Auditability** – Open-source and readable code
* 🔐 **Proven Cryptography** – No custom or experimental algorithms
* 🧠 **Simplicity** – Secure by design, simple to use
* 🌍 **Privacy First** – No telemetry, no tracking, no hidden data flows
* 🛡️ **Ethical Security** – Built to protect people, not to exploit them

## ✨ Features (Planned)

### Core (v0.1)

* File encryption and decryption
* Secure key generation
* Hashing and integrity verification
* Command Line Interface (CLI)

### Upcoming

* Message encryption
* Digital signatures
* Key rotation and expiration
* Compatibility with OpenPGP / OpenSSL formats
* Secure configuration profiles

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

OctaCrypt is built as a **modular toolkit**, allowing each component to be reviewed, tested, and extended independently.
